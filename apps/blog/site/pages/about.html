			<h2>A bit about me</h2>
			<p>Hi, <b>I am Pavel</b>, and in short I am a frontend enthusiast as some would say.</p>
			<p>
				I have been in web development for quite a bit and up to this day I can certainly say that I am still
				actively learning. There is so much to it, new libraries and frameworks constantly emerging, and we have
				only 24 hours in a day... but I try to stay up-to-date with the latest stuff!
			</p>
			<p>
				At my day-to-day job I have been leading and designing technical solutions, implementing features,
				mentoring and doing many things, but what I like the most is reverse engineering. To tell the truth,
				reverse engineering can really drain all the free time you have, so for that reason I decided to do it
				with clear purpose in mind.
			</p>
			<p>
				Throughout my career I have accumulated some knowledge, and now I have reached the point where I wanted
				to share all of it with the rest of the world and make it a better place.
			</p>

			<h2>About this blog</h2>
			<p>
				This is the platform where I will be conducting experiments, debugging, thinking out loud. Also, I am
				looking forward to new connections and feedback from peer engineers. Every entry in this blog is my
				chance to dive deeper into certain topic and explain to the readers in clear and understandable language
				my findings.
			</p>
			<p>
				I will take you on a journey throughout the web technologies and explain how it all works under the hood
				with real world examples. My goal is to have more people get better at creating of efficient and
				professional software.
			</p>

			<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
			<p>
				I try to produce content regularly, one article every week or so, however you never know when
				inspiration suddenly comes.
			</p>
			<p>So buckle up! We have a lot of work to do :)</p>
