Welcome to **Polar Hex blog**

## Who am I?

I am a frontend engineer who is very passionate about web development and modern technologies.
My goal is to spread knowledge that I have accumulated throughout my career
and just to have fun along the way.

## What to expect from this blog?

Here you can find a lot of material on different topics of frontend development including
guidelines about best practices, practical REAL world examples, functional programming,
reverse engineering of various NPM packages with explanations, performance tips and many more!

## For whom is this blog?

The target audience can vary. However, my initial goal is to create the material that is
so often missing from blogs nowadays and which I would really like to have personally when I
was growing as a web developer.
